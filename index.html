    <h3>How to Make a Mug Cake</h3>
    <p>
      You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in
      the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:
    </p>

    <h4>Mug Cake Ingredients</h4>
    <p>
      You likely already have all the ingredients for this chocolate mug cake
      recipe on hand. Here‚Äôs what you‚Äôll need:
    </p>
    
    <div class="Ingredients">
      <ul>
      <li>
        Flour: This easy chocolate mug cake recipe starts with all-purpose
        flour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sugar: Sugar sweetens things up and balances the bitter cocoa powder.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cocoa powder: Two tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa powder ensures a rich
        chocolate cake.
      </li>
      <li>
        Baking soda: Baking soda acts as a leavening agent, which means it helps
        the mug cake rise.
      </li>
      <li>
        Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor of the mug cake, but
        it won‚Äôt make it taste salty.
      </li>
      <li>
        Milk: Milk keeps the cake batter from drying out during the microwaving
        process.
      </li>
      <li>
        Oil: A neutral oil, such as canola oil, keeps the batter moist without
        adding flavor.
      </li>
      <li>Water: A tablespoon of water helps create the perfect texture.</li>
      <li>
        Vanilla: A dash of vanilla extract is the perfect finishing touch.
      </li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
      <h2>How to Make Cake In a Mug</h2>
      <br>
      It couldn‚Äôt be easier to make a homemade mug cake: Combine the dry 
      ingredients in a microwave-safe mug, stir in the wet ingredients, then cook in the microwave until the cake is done in the middle. You‚Äôll find the full, step-by-step recipe below with detailed instructions. 

      Tip from recipe creator safinabakes1231: ‚ÄúFor a healthier version, use 1 1/2 tablespoons of plain unsweetened applesauce instead of canola oil, and use 3 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon of water instead of milk.‚Äù
