    </p>

    <h4>Mug Cake Ingredients</h4>
    <p>
      You likely already have all the ingredients for this chocolate mug cake
      recipe on hand. Here’s what you’ll need:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Flour: This easy chocolate mug cake recipe starts with all-purpose
        flour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sugar: Sugar sweetens things up and balances the bitter cocoa powder.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cocoa powder: Two tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa powder ensures a rich
        chocolate cake.
      </li>
      <li>
        Baking soda: Baking soda acts as a leavening agent, which means it helps
        the mug cake rise.
      </li>
      <li>
        Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor of the mug cake, but
        it won’t make it taste salty.
      </li>
      <li>
        Milk: Milk keeps the cake batter from drying out during the microwaving
        process.
      </li>
      <li>
        Oil: A neutral oil, such as canola oil, keeps the batter moist without
        adding flavor.
      </li>
      <li>Water: A tablespoon of water helps create the perfect texture.</li>
      <li>
        Vanilla: A dash of vanilla extract is the perfect finishing touch.
      </li>
    </ul>
